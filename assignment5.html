        The resistor on each LED strip chunk is marked 181 (18 * 10 = 180Ω)<br>
        Total 9.9V drop from 3 white LEDs in series, and the power supply supplies 12V, so there's a 2.1V drop across the integrated resistor<br>
        (12V - 9.9V) / 180Ω = 0.0117A = 11.7mA -> current draw from 1 segment of 3 LEDs<br>
        The LED strip has 300 LEDs, so 0.0117A * 100 = 1.17A from the whole strip.<br>
        Since the transistor is in series with the LED strip, this is also subsequently the amount of current flowing through the transistor.<br>
        According to the datasheet, the drain current of the transistor is 32A, which is far above the current drawn from the strip, so it was fine there.<br>
        And I think there's not really much of a voltage drop across the transistor, since it's mostly just controlling current flow.

        Pin 9 is connected to the IR sensor and Pin 10 is connected to the transistor gate.<br>
        The external power supply isn't pictured because of the wild amount of alligator clips and wires -<br>
        But it's connected to the LED strip and the ground is connected to the ground of the Arduino.

      GIF is short for capacity sake, but the fade gets slower when the down button is pressed.<br>
      It subsequently fades faster when the up button is pressed (but not pictured)<br>
