        The voltage drop across yellow and green LEDs are all 1.8V, and each pin supplies 5V. <br>
        5V - 1.8V =  3.2V <br>
        And we want to run each LED with 20 mA of current, which is 0.02A <br>
        So with V = IR (ohm's law):<br>
        3.2V = 0.02A * R <br>
        R = 160Ω (or more) <br>
        I opted to use 220 ohm resistors for each LED because that's the closest
        stock resistor in the kit that is greater than 160Ω. <br>
        If I used one under 160Ω, that would be too much current for the LEDs.<br>
        <br>
        The voltage drop across a white LED is 3.3V.<br>
        5V - 3.3V = 1.7V <br>
        1.7V = 0.02A * R (assuming we want 20mA of current for this LED as well)<br>
        R = 85Ω (or more) - so I used a 100Ω resistor for the white LED.<br>
        <br>
        I didn't want an infinite amount of current running through when the button was unpressed, so I just put in a really large resistor (10kΩ).<br>
        It was also the resistor we used in class, so I figured it'd be a good bet.<br>
        Although I think the 5V pin is rated for 800mA - but USB ports only output 500mA.<br>
        So that calculation would be something like: 5V = 0.8A * R so R = 6.25Ω (or larger)

        Pin 2 goes to the button, and pin 8/10/12 connects to the white/green/yellow LEDs, respectively.<br>
        Each element is also connected to an appropriate resistor - <br>
        (10kΩ for the button, 100Ω for the white light and 350Ω for the green and yellow lights)

      The white light stays on when the button is unpressed. <br>
      Upon pressing the button, the green lights gradually fade into brightness while the yellow lights blink. <br>
      The button is released and the cycle repeats!
